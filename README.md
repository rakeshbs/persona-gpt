# Persona GPT

Persona GPT is just an experiment to create a chatbot with memory using embeddings in flat files instead of a vector database.

To run the code :
```
cargo run
```

The `character.txt` file contains the description of how the chatbot should reply. You can modify the file to change character of the bot.
