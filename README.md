# Persona GPT

Persona GPT is just an experiment to create a chatbot with memory using embeddings in flat files instead of a vector database. The implementation has been done in Rust.

To run the code :
```
cargo run
```

The `character.txt` file contains the description of how the chatbot should reply. You can modify the file to change character of the bot.

The `data` directory contains all the stored conversations with the embeddings.
